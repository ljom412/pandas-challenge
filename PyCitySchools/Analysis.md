Analysis

Based on the data detailing different schools' types (Charter or District), student populations, budget allocations, and academic performance metrics like average math and reading scores, as well as percentages of students passing math, reading, and overall, we can formulate a couple takeaways. Analyzing the data reveals that Charter schools tend to have smaller student populations, lower budgets per student, and higher academic performance compared to District schools. Additionally, there does not seem to be a correlation between higher spending per student and higher academic performance, as several of the schools with the highest spending per student also have some of the lowest overall passing rates. This could be due to several factors such as larger District schools with higher budgets not spending as efficiently as their smaller Charter counterparts or larger class sizes impacting students' ability to learn.
